Mostly a playground project for me to mess around with chatGPT and tool integrations.   



This application uses bcn.ActionFlow a custom redux-like architecture I set up to smoothly integrate new features, handle async behaviors, and manage states.
   
Currently integrates: ChatGPT, Google Cloud Platform, Google programmable search, wikipedia api(ish)
