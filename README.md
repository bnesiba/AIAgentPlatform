Mostly an playground project for me to mess around with chatGPT and tool integrations.
Application uses a custom redux-like architecture to smoothly integrate improvements, handle async behaviors, and manage state.
Currently integrates: ChatGPT, Google Cloud Platform, Google programmable search, wikipedia api(ish)
